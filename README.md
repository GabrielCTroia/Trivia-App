# G2i Trivia Game

![](demo/showcase.gif)

The App is built on top of Expo using Typescript & React Native. It was tested and optimized for iOS! 

For the UI I used Figma and for Project Management this Trello [board](https://trello.com/b/1zGqaFoH/g2i-challenge).

### Global Dependencies

- node
- typescript
- expo & expo-cli
- Xcode (optional)
- iPhone

### Run

npm start - Follow the Interactive shell

### Test

npm test

### Conclusion

This was a great challenge to work on. I took the time to play with the UI/UX a bit too, using Figma for the first time â€“ which is actually really awesome, and thus spent about a week on and off working on the whole app.

Looking forward for the feedback. Thank you!
